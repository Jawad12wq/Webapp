## Version Control Strategy

- We use a **feature branch workflow**, where each new feature is developed in its own branch.
- Branches:
  - `main`: Stable code that is ready for production.
  - `feature/*`: Feature branches for development.
- Merging:
  - Feature branches are merged into `main` via pull requests to ensure code reviews.
  - Conflicts are resolved during merges.
- Collaboration:
  - Team members work on their own branches and submit pull requests for review.
